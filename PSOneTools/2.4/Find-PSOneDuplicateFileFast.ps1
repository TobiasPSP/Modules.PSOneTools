      .SYNOPSIS
      Identifies files with duplicate content and uses a partial hash for large files to speed calculation up

      .DESCRIPTION
      Returns a hashtable with the hashes that have at least two files (duplicates). Large files with partial hashes are suffixed with a "P".
      Large files with a partial hash can be falsely positive: they may in fact be different even though the partial hash is the same
      You either need to calculate the full hash for these files to be absolutely sure, or add -TestPartialHash.
      Calculating a full hash for large files may take a very long time though. So you may be better off using other
      strategies to identify duplicate file content, i.e. look at identical creation times, etc.

      .EXAMPLE
      $Path = [Environment]::GetFolderPath('MyDocuments')
      Find-PSOneDuplicateFileFast -Path $Path
      Find duplicate files in the user documents folder

      .EXAMPLE
      Find-PSOneDuplicateFileFast -Path c:\windows -Filter *.log
      find log files in the Windows folder with duplicate content
