      .SYNOPSIS
      Faster Where-Object

      .DESCRIPTION
      Invoke-PSOneWhere can replace the built-in Where-Object and improves pipeline speed considerably.
      Invoke-PSOneWhere supports only the scriptblock version of Where-Object, so you can replace
    
      Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq 'Running' }
    
      with
    
      Get-Service | Invoke-PSOneWhere { $_.Status -eq 'Running' }
    
      but you cannot currently replace the short form of Where-Object:
    
      Get-Service | Where-Object Status -eq Running

      Invoke-PSOneWhere has a performance benefit per iteration, so the more objects
      you send through the pipeline, the more significant performace benefits you will see.

      Invoke-PSOneWhere is using a steppable pipeline internally which performs better.
      However because of this, the debugging experience will be different, and internal
      variables such as $MyInvocation may yield different results. For most every-day tasks,
      these changes are not important.

      A complete explanation of what Invoke-PSOneWhere does can be found here:

      .EXAMPLE
      $stopwatch = [System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch]::StartNew()

      $result = 1..1000000 | Invoke-PSOneWhere -FilterScript {
      $_ % 5
      }

      $report = '{0} elements in {1:n2} seconds' 
      $report -f $result.Count, $stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds
  
      Demos the speed improvements. Run this script to see how well it performs,
      then replace Invoke-PSOneWhere with the default Where-Object, and check out
      the performace difference. $result is the same in both cases.
