      .SYNOPSIS
      Faster ForEach-Object

      .DESCRIPTION
      Invoke-PSOneForeach can replace the built-in ForEach-Object and improves pipeline speed considerably.
      Invoke-PSOneForeach supports only the most commonly used parameters -Begin, -Process, and -End, so you can replace
    
      1..100 | ForEach-Object { 'Server{0:d3}' -f $_ }
    
      with
    
      1..100 | Invoke-PSOneForeach { 'Server{0:d3}' -f $_ }
    
      but you cannot currently replace instances of ForEach-Object that uses the less commonly used parameters,
      like -RemainingScripts, -MemberNames, and -ArgumentList

      Invoke-PSOneForeach has a performance benefit per iteration, so the more objects
      you send through the pipeline, the more significant performace benefits you will see.

      Invoke-PSOneForeach is using a steppable pipeline internally which performs better.
      However because of this, the debugging experience will be different, and internal
      variables such as $MyInvocation may yield different results. For most every-day tasks,
      these changes are not important.

      A complete explanation of what Invoke-PSOneWhere does can be found here:

      .EXAMPLE
      $stopwatch = [System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch]::StartNew()

      $result = 1..1000000 | Invoke-PSOneForeach -Process {
        "I am at $_"
      }

      $report = '{0} elements in {1:n2} seconds' 
      $report -f $result.Count, $stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds 
      
      Demos the speed improvements. Run this script to see how well it performs,
      then replace Invoke-PSOneForeach with the default ForEach-Object, and check out
      the performace difference. $result is the same in both cases.
